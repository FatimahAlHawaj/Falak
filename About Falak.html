    <h2> <br> Our Story </h2>
    <p> Our journey began as an idea in Tamayuz Mawhiba Program. We, as high school students, know how hard it is to find reliable, accessable resourses of physics and astronomy to gain our knowledge from. Thatâ€™s why we created this initiative, to help our peers expand their horizon, by offering the substance in both Arabic and English.Our goal is to spread knowledge across Saudi Arabia, and- one day, hopefully- the world. </p> <br></header>
    <main id="MainF"> <h2> Our Vision</h2> 
    <p>Falak is what we needed as high schoolers, and we hope that this portal would be the help the next generation has. As this initiative grow bigger, we want to include team members and let this joyful experience be shared with the people who are truly interested in it. We hope that this initiative couldexperience be shared with the people who are truly interested in it. We hope that this initiative could advocate the idea of outside-of-school science, and be the source of it. </p> </main>
